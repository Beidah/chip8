# Chip-8

## About

The Chip-8 emulator is a project written in Rust that allows you to run and play games developed for the Chip-8 virtual machine. The emulator is compiled to WebAssembly (Wasm) and embedded into a website, providing a seamless and interactive experience for users.

### What is Chip-8?

Chip-8 is an interpreted programming language developed in the 1970s. It was designed for early microcomputers and used to create simple video games and applications. The Chip-8 virtual machine interprets instructions and executes them on the underlying system.

### Future Enhancements

I might come back to this project and extend the Chip-8 instruction set to the Super Chip-8 or even XO-chip extenstions.

## üö¥ Usage

### üõ†Ô∏è Build with `wasm-pack build`

```
wasm-pack build
```

### Run the webapp

```
cd ./webapp
npm install
npm start
```
